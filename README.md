This is a Ruby on Rails exercise by the Le Wagon bootcamp.

The goal is to create a 'stupid coach programme'

The coach will provide you with coaching based on the user input. But is only capable of answering the following:

1. If the message is I am going to work, the coach will answer `Great!`
2. If the message has a question mark ? at the end, the coach will answer `Silly question, get dressed and go to work!.`
3. Otherwise the coach will answer `I don't care, get dressed and go to work!`

The goal is to learn how to branch out from building terminal apps to apps with web user interface.

If you wish to run this programme, you can fork this and run this on local server.
